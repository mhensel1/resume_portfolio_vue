            "bio": "As a Computer Science graduate of York College of Pennsylvania, I have vast experience in software development. Ever since I took my first programming course in my freshman year of high school, I have been in love with programming and software development. To me, software development is more than just a career or a means to create products, it is an art. To be able to take a simple idea and bring it to life piece by piece is a wonderful experience and one that I never grow tired of. I am hoping to utilize my skills and passion for software development in a professional setting and learn much more along the way."
